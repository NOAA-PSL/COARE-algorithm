Functions for COARE model version 3.6 bulk flux calculations.

Translated from MATLAB scripts written by Jim Edson and Chris Fairall, 
further edited by Elizabeth Thompson. Main Matalb script source is coare36vn_zrf_et.m

Execute '%run coare36vn_zrf_et' from the iPython command line for test run with
'test_36_data.txt' input data file. 
Code can also be imported as a module so that subfunctions can be used independently if desired.
List of functions in this code are:

#**************************************************************************
# VERSION INFO:
    
# Vectorized version of COARE 3.6 code (Fairall et al, 2003) with
# modification based on the CLIMODE, MBL and CBLAST experiments
# (Edson et al., 2012). The cool skin and surface wave options are included.
# A separate warm layer function can be used to call this function.
    
# This 3.6 version include parameterizations using wave height and wave
# slope using cp and sigH.  If these are set to NaN, then the wind
# speed dependent formulation is used.  The parameterizations are based
# on fits to the Banner-Norison wave model and the Fairall-Edson flux
# database.  This version also allows salinity as a input.
# Open ocean example Ss=35; Great Lakes Ss=0;
    
#**************************************************************************
# COOL SKIN:
    
# An important component of this code is whether the inputed ts
# represents the ocean skin temperature or a subsurface temperature.
# How this variable is treated is determined by the jcool parameter:
#   set jcool=1 if ts is subsurface or bulk ocean temperature (default);
#   set jcool=0 if ts is skin temperature or to not run cool skin model.
# The code updates the cool-skin temperature depression dT_skin and
# thickness dz_skin during iteration loop for consistency. The number of
# iterations set to nits = 6.
    
    jcoolx = 1
#**************************************************************************
### INPUTS:
    
# Notes on input default values, missing values, vectors vs. single values:
#   - the code assumes u,t,rh,ts,P,sw_dn,lw_dn,rain,Ss,cp,sigH are vectors;
#   - sensor heights (zu,zt,zl) latitude lat, longitude lon, julian date jd,
#       and PBL height zi may be constants;
#   - air pressure P and radiation sw_dn, lw_dn may be vectors or constants.
#   - input NaNs as vectors or single values to indicate no data.
#   - assign a default value to P, lw_dn, sw_dn, lat, zi if unknown, single
#       values of these inputs are okay.
# Notes about signs and units:
#   - radiation signs: positive warms the ocean
#   - signs and units change throughout the program for ease of calculations.
#   - the signs and units noted here are for the inputs.

#             (at height zu) and ocean surface current vector.
#             If not available, use true wind speed to compute fluxes in

#             adjust the eorw string input to albedo_vector function
#  jd = year day or julian day, where day Jan 1 00:00 UTC = 0
#  zi = PBL height (m) (default or typical value = 600m)

#### ADDITONAL CALCULATIONS:
    
#   using COARE output, one can easily calculate the following using the
#   sign conventions and names herein:
    
#     ### Skin sea surface temperature or interface temperature; neglect
#     ### dT_warm_to_skin if warm layer code is not used as the driver
#     #### program for this program
#           Tskin = ts + dT_warm_to_skin - dT_skin;
    
#     ### Upwelling radiative fluxes: positive heating the ocean
#           lw_up = lw_net - lw_dn;
#           sw_up = sw_net - sw_dn;
    
#     ### Net heat flux: positive heating ocean
#     ### note that hs, hl, hrain are defined when positive cooling
#     ### ocean by COARE, so their signs are flipped here:
#           hnet = sw_net + lw_net - hs - hl - hrain;

# CODE HISTORY:
    
# 1. 12/14/05 - created based on scalar version coare26sn.m with input
#    on vectorization from C. Moffat.
# 2. 12/21/05 - sign error in psiu_26 corrected, and code added to use variable
#    values from the first pass through the iteration loop for the stable case
#    with very thin M-O length relative to zu (zetau>50) (as is done in the
#    scalar coare26sn and COARE3 codes).
# 3. 7/26/11 - S = dT was corrected to read S = ut.
# 4. 7/28/11 - modification to roughness length parameterizations based
#    on the CLIMODE, MBL, Gasex and CBLAST experiments are incorporated
# 5. 9/20/2017 - New wave parameterization added based on fits to wave model
# 6. 9/2020 - tested and updated to give consistent readme info and units,
#    and so that no external functions are required. They are all included at
#    end of this program now. Changed names for a few things... including skin
#    dter -> dT_skin; dt -> dT; dqer -> dq_skin; tkt -> dz_skin
#    and others to avoid ambiguity:
#    Rnl -> lw_net; Rns -> sw_net; Rl -> lw_dn; Rs -> sw_dn;
#    SST -> Tskin; Also corrected heights at which q and P are
#    computed to be more accurate, changed units of qstar to kg/kg, removed
#    extra 1000 on neutral 10 m transfer coefficients;
# 7. 10/2021 - implemented zenith angle dependent sw_up and sw_net;
#    changed buoyancy flux calculation to follow Stull
#    textbook version of tv* and tv_sonic*; reformatted preamble of program for
#    consistent formatting and to reduce redundancy; resolved issues of
#    nomenclature around T adjusted to heights vs theta potential
#    temperature when computing dT for the purpose of sensible heat flux.

        # for the flux. The models do u v w, and then compute vector avg to get

        # are times when the wind is weak, insolation is high, and it matters a
        # lot. Using the original 1.37 coefficient resulted in many unwarranted
        # warm-skins that didn't seem realistic. See Wick et al. 2005 for details.
        # That's the last time the cool-skin routine was updated. The
        # absorption is not from Paulson & Simpson because that was derived in a lab.
        # It absorbed too much and produced too many warm layers. It likely
        # approximated too much near-IR (longerwavelength solar) absorption
        # which probably doesn't make it to the ocean since it was probably absorbed
        # somewhere in the atmosphere first. The below expression could
        # likely use 2 exponentials if you had a shallow mixed layer...
