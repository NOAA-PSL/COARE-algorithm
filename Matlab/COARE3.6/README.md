'coare36bvnWarm_et.m' is the main program. It calls the 'coare36bvn_zrf_et.m' function. 
'et' refers to Elizabeth Thompson contribution who has edited the code for some typos and 
added more comment so it is more reader friendly.

Meanwhile Chris made a new analytical cool skin function 'dcoolf2.m' and the version has 
evolved to 'coare36vn_zrf_et_cs.m'.  'cs' is for coolskin. The codes are present in the experimental coolskin folder for reference. Replace 'coare36bvn_zrf_et.m' by 'coare36bvn_zrf_et_cs.m' in 'coare36bvnWarm_et.m' if you want to use the new experimental coolskin scheme.
