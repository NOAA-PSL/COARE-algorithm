Python implementation of COARE air/sea flux algorithm version 3.5.

The python code runs the same data set used to exercise the matlab code. Execute '%run coare35vn.py' from the iPython command line for test run with 'test_35_data.txt' input data file. Edit line 554 to indicate path to test data file. This will output a file of results that you can compare to the test_35_output_py_082020.txt provided.  The file contains a time series of flux variables (usr	tau	hsb	hlb	hlwebb	tsr	qsr	zot	zoq	Cd	Ch	Ce	L	zet	dter	dqer	tkt	RF	Cdn_10	Chn_10	Cen_10 ).
